> Creates a vagrant environment bootstrapped with docker. This is useful for developing docker apps while chained to a windows environment that you wouldn't be using for deployment, and that isn't capable of natively provisioning the vagrant environment using docker. Instead we use a shell script to bootstrap the vagrant environment with docker and then you can develop from there.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-vagrant-docker using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-vagrant-docker
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo vagrant-docker
```
